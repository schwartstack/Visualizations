# Avocado Graph

This was an exercise in learning how to use matplotlib in Python. The goal was to display the relationship between exactly 4 variables in a graph.
The variables are: time (continuous variable), average sale price (continuous variable), type (categorical variable. Either organic or coventional),
and weekly sales (continuous variable).
The data originally came from https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices.
