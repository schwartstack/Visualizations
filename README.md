# Sunflower

The idea behind this visualization was to use trigonometry to recreate the spiral pattern you see in a sunflower's seed pods. 
It has nothing to do with data, but it is pretty and it's a neat exercise in mathematical thinking and programming.
The original idea came from, and was contributed by me to, http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sunflower_fractal.
