# MTV The Challenge

The Challenge is a show that has run on MTV for 35 seasons. Orginally they took cast members from the Real World
and Road Rules, but over the years it has opened up to many other shows they pull contestants from.
This visualization shows the progression of which cast members appeared on which seasons, in addition to
which show they originally appeared on (Real World, Road Rules, etc.), and what their result was on that particular 
season of the challenge (winner, finalist, etc.). The data originally came from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Challenge_(TV_series)_contestants
