# Prime Number Animations

primes.gif shows an animation of counting the instances of the digits occuring as the final digit in the first 1,000 primes.
primes2.gif shows the same thing, but for the first 100,000 primes, counting 1,000 primes at a time.
The list of primes came from http://www.naturalnumbers.org/primes.html.
