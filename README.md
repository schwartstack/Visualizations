# Vietnam War Draft Lottery

In December 1969, a lottery system, based on birthdays, was used to determine the order of call to military service in the Vietnam war. 
In this system, the days of each month were written on a slip of paper and stored in a capsule. Capsules for each month were poured and pushed 
aside (in monthly order) in a large wooden box which was then shook several times. Lottery number was then assigned to the birth date in order in 
which the capsules were drawn. The validity of the draft was later called into question. Was the randomness truly random, or was the draft unfair
to people born in certain times of the year? This plot suggests that the later in the year your birthday was, the earlier in the year you would
need to report for the draft, on average.
